My Friendly Study Group ;)
==========================

This group was created to refresh coding, problem analysis, and algorithm skills.

#### Format

At the beginning of each week a rotating member of the group will choose a question (from any source, yes even from your head is fine) for the rest of the group to work out for the duration of the week.
At the end of the week, the person who chose the question for the week will present their solution to the rest of the group. If anyone had any different solutions to the problem, they may present their
solution to the group after the first presentation, but it is the question-chooser's responsibility to come up with at least one solution to their own question and be able to present it (whiteboard, powerpoint, etc.)
to the rest of the group.
