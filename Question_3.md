Customers on longer flights like to watch a second movie immediately after the first one ends, but they often complain that their flight ends before the second movie is over. To fix this, we need to write a function that chooses two movies whose total runtimes equal the exact flight time.

Write a function that takes in as its parameters a fight length and a list of integers that represent the runtime of available movies and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not there are two movies whose sum equal the flight length.

Assumptions:
 - A customer will watch exactly two movies.
 - A customer will not watch the same movie twice.
 - Optimize for runtime over memory.
