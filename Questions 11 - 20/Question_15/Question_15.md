Well.... not quite always.

One stubborn cow wants to be different from the rest of the herd - it's that damn Wrong-Way Cow!


Task:

Given a field of cows find which one is the Wrong-Way Cow and return her position.

Notes:

There are always at least 3 cows in a herd
There is only 1 Wrong-Way Cow!
Fields are rectangular
The cow position is zero-based [x,y] of her head (i.e. the letter c)
