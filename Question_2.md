###Question:###

Write a function that performs set intersection. There are several different solutions to this problem, try to write a function that has the least time complexity.

_Note_: In mathematics, a set is a well defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three, written {2,4,6}. The intersection of two sets is the set of all things that are members of both set A and set B.
