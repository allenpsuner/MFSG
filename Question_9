### Question:
You are travelling up a staircase that contains a fixed number of steps _n_. You can traverse the staircase by either taking each step,
or by skipping a step (if possible).

Your task is to write a function that calculates the total possible ways you are able to traverse the staircase. For example,
if you have a staircase with 1 stair the output would be 1, or if you had a staircase with 3 stairs the output would be 3.

__Bonus:__
Include the time complexity of your algorithm and how you arrived at that answer.

### Solution:
