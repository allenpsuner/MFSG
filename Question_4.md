### Question:

#### Stacks and Queues

We're working in a legacy system and we've been tasked with creating a general purpose queue data structure. For some reason, in this legacy system we only have available a stack data structure to work with. Our queue should have an enqueue and dequeue methods. Describe how these methods would be implemented using the two stacks we have available to us.

Available Stack Methods:
- push()
- pop()
- isEmpty()

Queue Methods:
- enqueue()
- dequeue()
