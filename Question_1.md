You are a civil engineer constructing yet another bridge across Lake Washington. Your team has been constructing pieces of the bridge all year, and now it's time
to put them together. However, your team has made the pieces of the bridge variable length. Assume you have _n_ pieces of the bridge floating in the water with their
lengths defined as _L1_, _L2_, _L3_, ... _Ln_. The cost of putting two pieces of the bridge together is _Li_ + _Lj_, where _i_ and _j_ are two different pieces of the
bridge. Your task is to minimize the cost of creating the bridge. Use any strategy you wish, but provide a code snippet with your answer.
